# Lyricsify

Repo for DubHacks 2015.

This project is for converting songs from its original languange to any language that is chosen by the user. The user can then change the translation. Once changed, we will have a moderator who would view the changes the user made and authorize them. 

To run this, first you will need to install npm packages. 

> npm install 

This will install all the packages required to run the application. Then, you should run the node command.

> node server.js

To setup database in your local, run **createDatabase.sql** script and change credentials in **server.js** file.

Open **localhost:3000** and view the app! Enjoy!
